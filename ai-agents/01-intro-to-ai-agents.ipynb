    "- AI Agents are **systems** that enabled **LLMs** to **perform actions** by extending their capabilities by giving LLMs access to **tools** and **knowledge+Memory**.\n",
    "- Memory can be short-term in the context of conversation with the user, or long-term, outside of the information provided by the environment. Agents can retrieve knowledge from other systems, services, tools, and even other agents.\n",
    "- Components of a AI agent: Environment, Sensors, Actuators.\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to use AI Agents?**\n",
    "- **Open-Ended Problems**: LLM to determined required steps for a task because it cannot be hardcoded into a workflow.\n",
    "- **Multi-step Processes**: tasks that require a level of complexity in which the AI Agent needs to use tools or information over multiple turns instead of single shot retrieval.\n",
    "- **Improvement Over Time**: tasks where the agent can improve over time by receiving feedback from either its environment or users."
